# Vintage Bundles
Web performance matters. From SEO to bottom-line revenue impacts, performance can make or break your app. However, fixing performance feels like a quagmire of expert-level topics. What if I told you JavaScript bundle sizes could be cut up to 50% by doing one thing only? Nearly 90% of web traffic runs on modern browsers, but we're transpiling all of our JavaScript to ES5. Thatâ€™s expensive. In this talk, we'll learn about differential serving, or serving both modern bundles and legacy bundles using webpack. This talk is framework agnostic, and best if you have at least a basic understanding of JavaScript.
